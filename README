SFS stands for Small Fortran Solvers :-)

The embrio of this development started from algorithms in the book:

Numerical Analysis: Mathematics of Scientific Computing
by David Kincaid & Ward Cheney

Starting from sources cordialy provided by the authors, I was converging
towards the implementations in T-Flows.  Initial motivation was to check
wheather fill-in makes sense for ICCG solvers, but recenlty I realized that
they might also be useful to dive into GPU programming.
